 * Also, there is no guarantee that fetchPage() won't return an empty list,
 * even if isExhausted() return false (but it is guaranteed to return an empty
 * list *if* isExhausted() return true). Indeed, isExhausted() does *not*
 * trigger a query so in some (fairly rare) case we might not know the paging
 * is done even though it is.
