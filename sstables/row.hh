// sstables::data_consume_row feeds the contents of a single row into a

// * First, consume_row_start() is called, with some information about the
//   whole row: The row's key, timestamp, etc.
// * Next, consume_cell() is called once for every column.
// * Finally, consume_row_end() is called. A consumer written for a single

// consume_* functions, are passed as a "bytes_view" object, which points to
// internal data held by the feeder. This internal data is only valid for the
// duration of the single consume function it was passed to. If the object
// wants to hold these strings longer, it must make a copy of the bytes_view's
// contents. [Note, in reality, because our implementation reads the whole
// row into one buffer, the byte_views remain valid until consume_row_end()
